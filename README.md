## About
This game was created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The deck of cards is randomized at the beginning of each game, so no two games are the same.

JavaScript was used to build the game logic and to manipulate part of the existing HTML structure. CSS was used for styling and animating the cards based on the events happening (card is clicked, card was matched, card was not matched).

When all cards are matched, a success modal window pops up and displays the game's statistics: number of moves made, total time and star rating.
